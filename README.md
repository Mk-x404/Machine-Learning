# 🧠 Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to my **ML playground**, where I’m **learning and experimenting with different machine learning models** using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.  

The goal is simple: I try out different algorithms, see how they work, and **learn by doing**. This repo is beginner-friendly, so if you’re also starting out, you can follow along and see how each model works in practice.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

- **Regression Models:** Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso… basically anything that predicts numbers.  
- **Classification Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and more.  
- **Clustering & Unsupervised Learning:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA… exploring patterns in data.  
- **Visualizations:** Actual vs Predicted plots, residuals, confusion matrices — simple charts to understand the results.

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

- To **practice ML hands-on** while learning.  
- To show my **learning journey** in machine learning.  
- To provide examples for **other beginners** who want to see models implemented in Python.
